Netick is a free, server-authoritative, state-sync networking solution for Unity, built for performance, reliability, and ease of use. It’s a state-of-the-art networking solution, delivering industry-leading bandwidth efficiency and CPU performance, achieving the lowest bandwidth usage, as shown by [open-source benchmarks](https://github.com/StinkySteak/unity-netcode-benchmark). Designed with a fundamentally different architecture from other solutions, Netick makes developing cheat-resistant multiplayer games feel almost as simple as writing single-player games. Whether you’re building a competitive shooter, a casual party game, a 200-player battle royale, or a large-scale survival game, Netick is built to handle it all. It’s also the **only (state-sync) networking solution for Unity with a built-in replay system** and the only free one **proven to handle poor network conditions** - demonstrated [here](https://github.com/StinkySteak/unity-network-library-benchmark-on-bad-network-condition).
